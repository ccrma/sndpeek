# sndpeek
A real-time audio visualizer, originally created in 2005 by Ge Wang, Perry R. Cook, and Ananya Misra at the Princeton Sound Lab. It supports real-time waveform and 3D waterfall spectral visualization. See [the original sndpeek webpage](https://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/software/sndpeek/) and [its subsequent webpage at CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~ge/software/sndpeek/).

Created in 2025, this repository serves as the central sndpeek source repo, as maintained by the original team. We would like to acknowledge the community's work on sndpeek over the years, including two independent github repos [here](https://github.com/wickedchicken/sndpeek) and [here](https://github.com/inniyah/sndpeek). Sndpeek uses code from George Tzanetakis's MARSYAS (for real-time audio feature extraction and visualization) and Gary Scavone's RtAudio. This is the native C++ version of sndpeek. With [ChuGL](https://chuck.stanford.edu/chugl/) (3D graphics in Chuck), sndpeek (in minimal boilerplate form) also exists as [a ChucK program](https://chuck.stanford.edu/chugl/examples/deep/sndpeek.ck).
